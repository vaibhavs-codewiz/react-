# react app begin:
we are using the vs code editor other options sublime, vim .
and using nodejs to execute the code .
at first we create repository in github and run all the commands git init commit...
so that we can track or react app using github.
then we can create react app using different frameworks
start new project : option 1 is using custom , option2 utility create-react-app (high bundeler size) , option3 utility vite faster and create small bundeler size
option4 react meta framework nextjs, gatsby, remix.

in create-react-app there are node modules available with it 
but in vite we install it using npm i command 

vite is a bundeler which bundels all files into one.
break down of npm create vite@latest
npm: This refers to the Node Package Manager, a tool used to install and manage JavaScript packages. Think of it as a giant storehouse for pre-built tools and components for JavaScript projects.
create: This is a command within npm that specifically initiates the creation of a new project based on a pre-defined template. Imagine it as a special function within the storehouse that helps you set up a new workspace with all the necessary tools.
vite: This refers to the specific template or project generator you're using in this case. Vite is a relatively new and lightweight bundler for building modern web applications. In the storehouse analogy, Vite would be a particular pre-built toolbox containing all the components you need to construct a specific type of project.
@latest: This symbol junto with "latest" instructs npm to use the most recent version of the vite template available at the time you run the command. Imagine checking a box that says "Get the newest version" when picking up your Vite toolbox.
# why nodejs
There are two main reasons why Node.js is commonly used alongside React for creating React applications:

Development Environment:  While React itself runs in the browser, Node.js provides the tools needed to develop and build React applications efficiently. Here's how:

Package Management: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) which lets you easily install and manage all the JavaScript libraries and tools your React app needs, like React itself. It's like having a handy inventory system for all the building blocks of your application.
Bundling: React code is often written in separate files. Node.js tools like vite can bundle all these files together into a single, optimized file that can run in the browser. This makes your app run smoother and load faster. Imagine bundling all the different parts you built for a toy car into a single box before giving it to someone to play with.
Development Server: Node.js can be used to create a local development server. This server lets you test your React app as you build it, without needing to deploy it online every time you make a change. It's like having a personal testing ground to play with your car before showing it off to the world.
Backend API (Optional):  React handles the user interface (UI) of your application.  But most web applications also need a backend server to handle things like data storage, user authentication, and communication between the app and a database. Node.js is a popular choice for building these backend APIs because:

Shared JavaScript: Both React and Node.js use JavaScript. This allows developers to use the same language for both the front-end and back-end, reducing the need to learn and switch between different programming languages. It's like using the same building blocks for both the car's interior and exterior.
Performance: Node.js is known for its efficiency in handling many concurrent connections, which can be beneficial for web applications that deal with a lot of user interaction. This is important for making sure your car can handle all the bumps and turns it might encounter on the road.
In short, Node.js isn't strictly necessary for React to run, but it provides a powerful and convenient toolkit for developing, building, and potentially even powering the backend of your React applications.
# how react works behind the work :-
React and JSX work together to create a seamless user interface development experience. Here's a breakdown of how they work together and the role of Babel in this process:

React and JSX
JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX Syntax:

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML.
It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which makes it easier to visualize the UI structure within the code.
JSX in React:

JSX is used in React to describe what the UI should look like.
Each JSX element is a syntactic sugar for React.createElement(component, props, ...children).
For example:
jsx
Copy code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
This JSX code is transformed into:
javascript
Copy code
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
Babel
Role of Babel
JSX Transformation:

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms JSX into standard JavaScript.
When you write JSX code, Babel takes that syntax and converts it into the React.createElement calls that React understands.
This transformation allows browsers to execute the JSX code, even though browsers donâ€™t natively understand JSX.
Modern JavaScript Features:

Babel also compiles modern JavaScript (ES6/ES7/ES8, etc.) into older versions of JavaScript that can run in all browsers.
This ensures compatibility and allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features without worrying about browser support.
Plugins and Presets:

Babel uses plugins to transform specific syntax. For JSX, the @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx plugin is used.
Presets are collections of plugins. For instance, @babel/preset-react includes all necessary plugins to transform React JSX and modern JavaScript.
How It All Works Together
Writing Code:

Developers write components using JSX in their React applications.
Example:
jsx
Copy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
};
Babel Transforms Code:

Babel processes this JSX code during the build step.
It transforms the JSX into React.createElement calls.
Example transformed code:
javascript
Copy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  return React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello, world!');
};
React Renders the UI:

React takes these createElement calls and converts them into a virtual DOM representation.
React then efficiently updates the real DOM to match the virtual DOM.
Example Workflow
Code Input:

jsx
Copy code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
Babel Transformation:
Babel transforms the JSX into JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
React Rendering:

React interprets the createElement call.
It updates the virtual DOM and then the real DOM to display <h1>Hello, world!</h1> in the browser.
Summary
JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, making UI development more intuitive.
Babel transforms JSX and modern JavaScript into code that browsers can understand.
React uses the transformed code to update the DOM efficiently, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the application's state.
This process ensures a smooth and efficient development workflow, enabling the use of modern syntax and features while maintaining compatibility across different browsers

# js need to get into html file to work
whatever the app you are building the core working is that js code will get inside the HTML file. using script tag.
public folder contains the index.html file which contain the root tag which will contain all the js react code . due to single index html file it is also called as the single page application.
index.html file does not contain any script tag then how js get injected ?
so this is done by scripts present in package.json file this happen behind the scenes. this all happen in create react app but vite have inbuilt script tag in html file.
in vite the name of components should have jsx extension due to its internal configuration but in create-react-app js or jsx can use any .
also in vite the name of component and its function should be capitalized.(in all framework)
also in jsx during return we are allowed to return only single fragement and not multiple fragements.
in vite the script tag is receiving methods from its dependencies(package.json) which are react and react dom.
