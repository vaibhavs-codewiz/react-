# react router dom
Imagine a big mansion (your React application) with many rooms (components). React Router is like the hallway that helps you move between rooms without going outside (reloading the entire app).

Here's how it works:

Define the Rooms: You tell React Router which component belongs to each URL path (e.g., "/home" shows the home component, "/about" shows the about component).
Navigation: Clicking a link or typing a URL tells React Router which room to go to. It smoothly transitions you between components without reloading everything.
Here are some common use cases:

Multi-page Application: Build an app that feels like multiple webpages (like an online store), but everything runs within the same browser window.
Dynamic Routing: Show different content based on the URL. For example, "/products/:id" could display a specific product page based on the product ID in the URL.
Navigation Control: Decide how users navigate your app. You can control what happens when they click a back button or refresh the page.
React Router makes your React application feel more like a traditional website, with a smooth user experience and clear organization.
